            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

But he bids stand and behold, <hi>i. e.</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to wait and watch, and observe; for there's no safe way, but the good old way: which, what it is, I shall endevour to shew, according to what I find in Scripture; and to me it seems that it is that pure old rule, and royall law, which God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor first gave to mankind: It seems to me, it cannot be that law in Tables of Stone, given by <hi>Moses,</hi> for that was given with terrors, (and terrors and blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse are opposites) nor is it that law given <hi>Nouh</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106062:3"/> his sons, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. for that could be no more, then a Law of a carnall commandement, and there was a fear in it, which we may see by the effect, it hath begotten fear in men; but a good law, cannot ingender bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage or fear; besides, this law is concluded with beasts, birds, and fishes, also which three last were not crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the image of God; and this law is such, that enmity and fear is extremly risen, betwixt men, beasts birds and fishes, and that Law never made any thing perfect and good; Therefore we must look for an el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and better Law, which I find set down to us in Precepts, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. the words are, <hi>And God blessed them, and said, be fruitfull and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the Sea, and over the fowl of the Aire, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</hi> And next verse, <hi>God appoints them food.</hi> In v. 26, 27. Its said, <hi>God made man in his image, after his likenesse,</hi> which being duly considered, will give us better to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what is the scope of the Precepts in verse 28.</p>
            <p>And thus 1, God blessed them, <hi>i. e.</hi> put them in a condition free from fear, as not subject to destiny or death.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Be fruitfull and multiply, and replenish the earth,</hi> All this was man to do, in the image wherein he was created, and not otherwises.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Subdue it,</hi> and keep it under, <hi>i. e.</hi> the earth: for the Hebrew Text, I understand it not, and I never read the place in the Greek translation, but in <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes</hi> Latin Bible, I find the word <hi>subjicite,</hi> w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to cast down, or put under; and I conceive when God had made man of the earth, and had given him
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106062:3"/> reason to know his matter of which he was made, and his Maker who is, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> God the eternall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that it was, and is most meet and equall, man should live in that Spirit, and walk in it, that so he might bring forth the fruits of it, which is that image of God, and keep under the earth or flesh, lest by a predominancy of flesh or earth, the image of God might become defaced in him (as after came to passe) that this is the meaning of this Precept, in these four first words, <hi>i. e. Be fruitfull and multiply, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish the earth and subdue it.</hi> Me thinks the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture plainly proveth, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.9.10. the Apostle prayes for that Church v. 10. <hi>That that Church may be fruitfull in every good work, and abound in the knowledge of God,</hi> and v. 9. <hi>That they may be fulfilled with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his heavenly will, in all wisdome and spirituall understanding.</hi> Here is to be fruitfull, and to abound or increase, which is to multiply and to be fulfilled, which is to replenish; for the fourth &amp; last word, <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the earth,</hi> Col. 3.1, 2, 5, 16. in verse 4. <hi>Mortifie your members,</hi> i. e. flesh, verse 16. <hi>Let the word of Christ dwell in you, in all wisdome plenteously; the word of Christ is a quickning Spirit,</hi> but concerning keeping under the flesh, consider <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3. and 5.16, 17, 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the rest of the royal law or precept in verse 28. is in these words, <hi>Have Dominion over the fish of the Sea, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the fowls of the aire, and over every living thing that moveth on the earth: Have Dominion,</hi> This is vulgarly taken to be as much as to domineere, or have power over, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But me thinks reason and truth will not extend it so far. But onely to the having a rule or trade of living to Gods glory, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106062:4"/> with God, above what God had appointed for Beasts, Birds, and Fishes: But in discourses I have heard affirmative Conclusions drawn from these words, that the image of God in man, in which he was created, was in the dominion then given man: But man had not such dominion and power given him as is supposed; for I suppose there is a follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Letter too close, which brings into a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, and misunderstanding of the word of God, which is spirit and life; for if the image were in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning beasts, birds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then onely Cowherds, Swineherds, Falconers, and such, were onely in the image. Also we see great rich men, or men of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown make poore men serve them, as they make beasts serve them, and then it would be consequent that great men are the image, and poore men not, but Christ died for the poore, as <hi>Psalm</hi> 12.5. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.22. and if beasts, birds and fishes were in a condition that had need to be tamed; then could they not be very good: For constraint and war have ever been reckoned among evills, and if man was to slay and eat them, then to what end did God appoint food, verse 29. for then should the living God (on whom the creature by groans calls for, and waits for restauration) be the author of the destruction of the same creature: But (me thinks the words ought to be undrstood thus, <hi>i. e.</hi> God having made man in his image, said, <hi>Be fruitfull and multiply, and replenish the earth:</hi> all this ought to be in that image, and not out of it; then he sayes <hi>Subdue the earth and have domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or rule.</hi> I think its not meant they should tame beasts by fighting &amp; contending, and so overcoming
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106062:4"/> them, as afore is said, see <hi>Job</hi> 35.10, 11, 12, 13. But they should walk and live in a rule, way, or royall Law, above what beasts, birds and fishes were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to walk and live in; <hi>i. e.</hi> they should keep all beastly, carnall, greedy affections, and earthly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse out of their thoughts, and understandings, and wills▪ and should alwayes will the good perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rest, and peace of the Creation, so as it might be conserved in conformity to God in that good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he made it: but if it be asked how came it to passe that man did not fulfill Gods mind and will herein, all the answer I can give herein is, that I conceive Man had his mind misled and perverted, forgetting his God and Maker, when he beheld the variety of creatures, and abundances of all things, imagining he might produce Issue as beasts did, <hi>Sowed to the flesh, and of the flesh reaped coruption;</hi> he got a child, and said, I have gotten a child from the Lord, and so he was, and not of God; but in the similitude of sinfull <hi>Adam:</hi> also <hi>Adam</hi> called his wife the mother of all living, but she was not so, but the mother of all dead, for the Virgin is the mother of all living, and her son (a Virgin) brings children to God, and he while on earth, increased, multiplyed, replenished the earth, and kept it under, and walked in a way above wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> fishes, beasts and birds walkt in; not in a way to tame them, beat them or otherwise hurt them, but by farre transcending those wayes in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the knowledge of Heavenly things, in knowledge above what is imparted to those crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, even onely knowing God in the divine nature, and participating with God in that divine nature, he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106062:5"/> walked in a way, against which is no Law, for he was, and is the Law, pure, holy and good, and his bringing children, is not by careing for the flesh, or the world; nor by the works of the flesh, but by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and holinesse, walking in the Father, who is God eternall, power, pure, holy, rationall, and above all; for he had descended, and was to ascend; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he daily died to the world, by self denying, and patient crosse bearing; that life and immortality might be brought to light by the Gospel, he was and is the Gospel. Thus much me thinks may give to understand, what the good old way is, here in Text commanded to be looked after, even the old way of pure integrity, and perfection in which man was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, into w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> the Creation shall be restored by Christ.</p>
            <p>Now to the latter part of the Text, here the sadnes of the story follows, God is exceeding merciful to mankind, and invites to return to himself through Jesus Christ his son, who is life and salvation; but man doth not consider that his first Parents for their transgression were driven out of Paradice, where they had visions of God, so as man is blind towards God, and seeth not the goodnesse of his maker, nor the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his Commandements in the pure Creation; and so rather than man will obey and turn into the good old way, he will perish. In some stories its writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Jews, that they very readily knew the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Scriptures, but they knew them but carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accordingly as wordly men know things, or, beasts know things, for they made no spirituall use of them; they knew the story of the Fathers, and of Gods mercies, and wondrous works in delivering Israel out
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106062:5"/> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in overthrowing enemies, and giving them rest; they knew God gave their Fathers the Law in <hi>Horeb,</hi> in a terrible manner, all the Mount being on fire, yet they kept not his Law; they soon forgat his wonders; they knew their Fathers in severall ages were distressed by enemies, and brought to learn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God by the things they suffered under those enemies; then crying to the Lord he delivered them: and now here in this story they be distressed again, and God sends his Prophet, and bids them ask for the old way, which is the good way, and walk therein, and they shall find rest for their souls, but they said, we will not walk therein. Here their conclusive resolution is a very sad expression, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejecting the counsells of God, against themselves, chusing the evill and refusing the good, (and from the Text) it may be inferred, that he that walks in the good old way, shall have full delight, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory contentment, in, and to all his five senses, for I take that to be the Soul) if it should be asked, what might be the reason why the Jews thus reject the counsells of God, and chuse the evill and refuse the good? I answer, it is because man is in a condition or state, darker and inferiour to that wherein he was created, into which <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> our first Parents brought mankind (by transgressing the command of God) wherein man cannot see his God, nor know him, nor know what pertains to life and godlinesse, (read the three first Chapters of <hi>Genesis) God made man, and placed him in Paradise,</hi> which signifies a place of vision; where God shewed himself to man, and conferred with man, and was seen of man, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106062:6"/> man had transgressed, and was therefore driven out into a remote place, where God hath not si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence been seen or heard of, but by some choice persons, and that as <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. and when God sent his Son, the world could not, nor would not know him, who was <hi>Immanuel,</hi> the manifestation of God: man in this state can see nothing, but of the world, as the world seeth, he can see no more of God than the ignorant world, but by a mighty word of God enlightening, (who never left himself without witnes) man cannot enter again into Paradise, but by Jesus Christ, whom as afore is said, the world know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, nor can know: this is evident by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. throughout, and <hi>John</hi> 9. latter end, and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. This is mans lamentable condition, lying under the power of darknesse, spoken of in <hi>Luke</hi> 22.53. Let all men generally take up lamentations: I see not, but that <hi>Jonah</hi> and the <hi>Ninivites,</hi> are for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples through all ages, <hi>Jonah</hi> of Christ and all Gods messengers, the <hi>Ninivites</hi> of the universality of people, who are ever doing, and will be doing, but they know not what, and so do sin continually. Let all consider, if a man were on the top of an hill, he might see afarre off, but if he be driven from the hill, he cannot but have visions within a valley. God in Paradise manifested himself to his creature, that is our hill, but man is driven thence, hath faln from a fellowship with his maker, and hath lost his image or likenes, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. so that every one looks a subsistence elsewhere, and none waits on God, nor walks in his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, but separated from God, remain in death, &amp; not in life, for there is no life but in the image of God,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106062:6"/> when Christ was on the earth, he alone lived, and all men were dead, and if any lived, it was a life recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by and from Christ, who quickeneth the dead. Let all that desire perfection in the love of God, take up lamentations and be afflicted in themselves, for and in respect of a generall darknesse grown o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all mankind, making a separation betwixt God and mankind; making mankind to quench the light of God, and his spirit by fleshly lusting, luxury, pride, ambition, covetousnesse, envy, malice, cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, contempt, and all vanity, and uncleannnesse; which may all be summed up in this; he Twrath of God (<hi>Rom.</hi> 16.) is revealed from heaven against all ungodlinesse, and unrighteousnesse of men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for never any polluted with these or any of these, but confesse a Deity, and professe to worship the same, but forgetting the power thereof, hold the truth of God in unrighteousnesse; then it may be said, the wrath of God is revealed from heaven, not that wrath is in God, or in his presence, or in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but men doing the works of the flesh, are said to be separated from the presence of God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.2. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.21. and by what God is in them, are judged in themselves, and struck into fearfullnesse, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>Adam</hi> said, <hi>I was afraid,</hi> and Psalm 90. <hi>As is thy fear, so is thy wrath;</hi> If it be not thus, I conceive not how wrath should go out of God, in whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture never was any such thing; but man by acusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med fleshly working, procreates irksomnesse, which begets fear, and fear wrathfullnesse: So is mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of himself, by such working in himself, all iniquity, which the pure eyes of God cannot behold;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106062:7"/>
               <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. and consider mans activity is his greatest enemy. And lament the universall darknesse, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of mankind, who will not know Jesus Christ whom God hath sent to be to us a manifestation of the good old way. I cannot make account that ever I saw a Christian, one that had truly learned Christ. There is a generall forgetfullnesse, that God hath said, <hi>the Earth is the Lords, and the fullnesse thereof,</hi> for men generally, are after the world, covetous of enjoying the earth, and earthly wealth, and stand much on propriety, and blesse themselves in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of earthly things which they enjoy, and therefore have their fellow creatures in contempt, not considering that Christ had not whereon to lay his head; nor had his Apostles Silver, or Gold. Let all people learn Christ, which to do, <hi>Search the scriptures for herein ye think to have life eternall, and they testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie of me</hi> saith Christ, <hi>John</hi> 53. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Learn of me that I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</hi> Now I say, learn Christ, say not as the Tex saith, we will not. Now for the method to learn Christ; I conceive our hearts must be pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after him, as <hi>Psalm</hi> 42. Our eyes looking unto him, who is the Authour and Finisher of our Faith, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>And let all Israel wait on the Lord from henceforth and for ever, Psalm</hi> 131.3. And Gods appointments are certain, the vision is for an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, though it tarry, wait. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3. and in <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.31. <hi>They that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall lift up their wings as the Eagle, they shall run and not be weary, and they shall walk and not faint.</hi> So I conceive, they that will learn Christ
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106062:7"/> must wait on the anointing of him, whereby they may know and do all things, and become the Sons of God with Christ, and partake of his fullnesse grace for grace, even the whole Divine Nature. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7▪ 4. last verse, <hi>Paul</hi> lamenting a fleshly condition. cryes out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> and he answers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi> Hence a moralized Philosopher may make some question hereof; but the beginning of the next, Chapter wil clear it, verse 1. Now then there is no condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them that are in Christ Jesus, which walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</p>
            <p>This notes first, that Saints (lesse they cannot be) in Christ are free from impeachment, past judgement, they be blessed for ever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They walk not after the flesh, nor barely after the Letter, because Christ, is not now so known, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16, 17. but after a new life in, and by a quickening spirit, for the flesh profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>But Thirdly, they live after the spirit, for the Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, freeth them from the Law of sin and death; Thus learn ye Christ in this new and living way, in the Spirit of the Lord, where is liberty and freedome in holinesse: This me thinks is the grace and glory of Christ, and he that hath learned Christ thus, liveth, and knoweth that he liveth everlastingly, by force of the word of truth or Christ dwelling richly in him, <hi>i. e.</hi> the spirit of life: He can cut off a hand, or pull out an eye or any other Member that offends Christ in him,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106062:8"/> and cast it from him, and will sell all and give to the poore, &amp; follow Christ, and take up his Crosse without offence or sorrow; for he looks not on (with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) things that are seen which are but tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but on things that are not seen which are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. He lives upon this promise, <hi>Thou shalt have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in heaven:</hi> He knoweth, <hi>God who hath promised is faithfull,</hi> and that sufficeth.</p>
            <p>Learn Christ, read <hi>Luke</hi> 9.23, 24. and 14.47. Christ there saith not, Study to be wise or great in this world, for he medled not with worldly businesse, nor was it his businesse to support any state or pomp in worldly affairs, nor ever gave he his advises in worldly matters: consider what Christ saith here, <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his Crosse daily and follow me, for whosoever will save his life shall lose it,</hi> &amp;c. and Chap. 14.27. is <hi>Whosoever beareth not his Crosse and cometh after me, cannot be my disciple;</hi> this is contrary to the world and the flesh, for the spirit of the world is to build <hi>Babels,</hi> and name them Paradises in the World, but they that have learned Christ seek no such habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>but look for one eternall in the heavens, whose buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and maker is God.</hi> 1 John 3.16. <hi>He laid down his life for us,</hi> O that we could learn to have like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passions towards our brethren and fellow-creatures. <hi>Paul</hi> holds out the same Spirit of Christ in severall places, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.31. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.10, 11, 12. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.21, 22, 23. All these Scriptures are worthy much conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but they be not held forth in any ones pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, that I ever saw: men are rather greedy of worldly preferment, to usurp officious rule and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106062:8"/> power over poore men their fellow creatures, then to deny self, and take up a Crosse as Christ did, <hi>John</hi> 6. the people would have made him King, but he would not (his Kingdome was not, nor is of this world) he rather chose to suffer persecution and death, As it was with Christ, <hi>All that will live godly in Christ must suffer persecution, its their Crown, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, their triumph.</hi> Now to get into the good old way, of which Christ is a manifestation, let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one learn with and through Christ to die to the World, and to all Fleshly, and Worldly usurpations, affections, and desires; and to know Christ, consider <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.17.20.21. &amp; 14.19. <hi>My Father worketh hitherto and I work;</hi> 20. <hi>for the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things, whatsoever he himself doth, and he will shew him greater works then these, that ye should mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell.</hi> 21. <hi>For likewise as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, so the Son quickeneth whom he will,</hi> and chap. 14.1. <hi>Ye believe in God, believe also in me,</hi> and v. 9. <hi>He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father.</hi> Now of all these phrases of Scripture, the force is, that men may not make distinctions betwixt Father and Son, but as I conceive, this meaning is to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that God loveth his annointed Son (in whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever) shewing him what ever he doth (being one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good) to teach him to do the same. The Father and the Son, one God worketh continually; the works of the Father and Son, are works of one God, God maketh to be things that are not, the Father rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from death, giveth life, Christ quickeneth whom he will, by one and the same power of God. Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers cannot but believe in God, the Godhead dwells
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106062:9"/> in Christ, he and the Father are one, if ye see Christ ye see the Father, God is one: All this is marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to men, who look for the Kingdome of God to come with observation, or in some extraordinary pompous power, but the Kingdome of God cometh not with observation. Let none despise the day of small things, the lowly habitations or condiscen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, who will dwell with the lowly heart, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very tree is known by its fruit,</hi> God is a most holy, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully and pure spirit, and where you shall see Love, Joy, Peace, Long-suffering, Gentlenesse, Goodnesse, Faith, Meeknesse, and Temperance, there is God and Christ of a truth, and if these be and abound in any, they will not be idle nor unfruitfull in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and then the dyings of Christ and his life, will be manifest in their mortall body, such will be ready to lay down life for the Creation, that Satan and wickednesse may be destroyed, that the Creation may be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and receive the new life. This will follow if Christ be in any the hope of glory, for it is Christs businesse to make all things new, <hi>All power in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in earth is given him,</hi> he is, and shall be above all: Angels, Powers and Mights, are and shall be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him, he is one with the Father, God blessed for ever: Learn to follow him not Beliall, not the God of the World, but Christ, Christ and Belial cannot stand together, Belials Centre is but at the earth, Christs in the highest glory of God, Christs wayes are not after the flesh, nor after the World, but his wayes are Holinesse, Righteousnesse, Truth, Humility, Meeknesse and Mercy, his Mercies are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106062:9"/> over all his works: He laid down his life for sinners his enemies, he rose from the dead, and liveth ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. He hath redeemed our lives from the grave, and crowneth us with mercy and compassion: He will gather the whole Creation of God, up unto God to live with him in the Kingdome of glory, where shall be everlastingly; praise the Lord.</p>

            <p>In the beginning God made all good, pure, and perfect, the man and woman were so in their first condition, and that they were in the favour of God, may not be denyed, at consequence whereof is, they were not carnally nor world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected; for the one is death, <hi>Rom:</hi> 8. and the other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.

The end of the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Christ is but to attain the divine nature: he that will be his Disciple must deny himself, and the life of the flesh, that God may breath into him the spirit of life in Christ Jesus, that such a Disciple may say with <hi>Paul, Not I now, but Christ liveth in me;</hi> this is pure Virgins-life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. attributes Virginity to both men and women following the Lamb, <hi>Iohn</hi> heard voices of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and thunders, which I conceive were troubles, hideous assaults, floods of persecution cast out of the mouths of who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish people against them, but they had their Fathers name written in their foreheads, therein they overcame those that assaulted them; for <hi>Iohn</hi> heard also the voice of harps, they sung the triumphant song of <hi>Moses,</hi> for its likely their conflict was no lesse, then was that of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Israelites at passing through the Red sea: Consider what dammage it had been if they had been defiled; I judge they rather should have been in the bottom of the sea, with <hi>Pharaob</hi> and his host, then to have

Who though their eyes sleep, yet their hearts are waking; the light of Gods countenance in the face of Jesus Christ is still shining there as oyle, supplying their Lamps of their godly professions, and in that unspeakable light they preserve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the rule of the Law of God, chaste, pure, and spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse virgins to enter into the Bride chamber with the pure and chaste Bridegroom the Lord Christ, and as <hi>Eccles.</hi> 1.18. and 3, 18.</p>

Some curious one hence will querie, what was the transgression? and the Text answers eating the forbidden tree, but then, what was that? it was mans mistake in the Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, and especially in the act of production of fruitfulnesse, and multiplication, for they produced carnally as beasts, who had a Law in the same words, but were never in the same image, and I cannot conceive Gods mind was man should be fruitfull and multiply out of the image wherein he was created. Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider seriously, <hi>Adam</hi> never had any child which was not in the similitude of sinfull <hi>Adam,</hi> but that was not the image wherein God made him; God said to beasts, in their kind, <hi>Be fruitfull,</hi> &amp;c. but God made man in his image, and said, <hi>Be fruitfull,</hi> God fitted <hi>Adam</hi> with his image, and in the knowledge of good on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that in himself, and his presence not separate from himself, nor out of his presence.
